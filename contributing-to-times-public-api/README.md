### Contributing to TPA (Times Public API)

#### Who is this for?
If you currently contribute to TPA or think you might in the near future then this is relevant to you. Also if you're curious to see how we work then feel free to come along. If not then I apologise, I tried to pick the most appropriate distribution list!

#### What's this about?
We've interviewed a bunch of developers across The Times to understand more about the developer experience behind contributing to TPA. We've identified various strengths and weaknesses of the codebase and our working practices. The purpose of this presentation is to help address issues that were raised and answer some of the most asked questions.

#### What will you learn?
- Where to find documentation about TPA and what is documented
- How TPA is structured and the philosophy behind it
- How to make common changes
- How pull requests and deployments work
- Maybe some more...
